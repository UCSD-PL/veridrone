<p class="lead">Errors in cyber-physical systems can lead to disastrous
  consequences. Classic examples date back to the Therac-25 radiation
  incidents in 1987 and the Ariane 5 rocket crash in 1996. More recently,
  Toyota's unintended acceleration bug was caused by software errors, and
  certain cars were found vulnerable to attacks that can take over key
  parts of the control software, allowing attackers to even disable the
  brakes remotely. Pacemakers have also been found vulnerable to attacks
  that can cause deadly consequences for the patient.</p>

<p class="lead">To reduce the chances of such errors happening, this
  project investigates the application of a technique called Foundational
  Verification to cyber-physical systems. In Foundational Verification, the
  system being developed is proved correct, in full formal detail, using a
  Proof Assistant. Because proofs in Foundational Verification are carried
  out in such complete detail, this project will pave the way to reaching
  previously unattainable levels of safety for cyber-physical systems. To
  make sure that the techniques in this project are practical, they will be
  evaluated within the context of a real flying quadcopter. Although the
  initial work focuses on quadcopters, the concepts, ideas, and research
  contributions have the potential for transformative impact on other kinds
  of systems, including power-grid software, cars, avionics and medical
  devices (from pacemakers and insulin pumps to defibrillators and
  radiation machines).</p>
