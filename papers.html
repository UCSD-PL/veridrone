<p><b>Abstract:</b>
Due to their safety-critical nature, cyber-physical systems (CPS) demand
the most rigorous verification techniques. However, the complexity of the
domain puts many cyber-physical systems outside the scope of automated
verification tools. Formal deductive proofs hold the potential to verify
virtually any property of any system, but proofs for practical
cyber-physical systems often require an impractical amount of manual
effort. This proof burden can be mitigated by capturing common reasoning
patterns in powerful higher-order proof rules. Existing work has focused on
proof rules applicable to arbitrary hybrid systems (a formal model for
CPS), but many systems actually fall into more constrained classes. One
such class of systems are called sampled-data systems, in which a discrete
controller runs periodically. In this dissertation, we complement general
hybrid system proof rules with a series of rules that leverage the
particular structure of sampled-data systems. We demonstrate the
applicability of these rules on the double integrator, an important model
in robotic and vehicle systems. All work is formalized in the Coq proof
assistant, whose expressive logic is crucial to maintaining soundness while
applying domain-specific proof rules for sampled-data systems. Finally, we
experimentally evaluate our results by implementing verified controllers on
a quadcopter and conducting flight tests.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Unsafe behavior of cyber-physical systems can have
disastrous consequences, motivating the need for formal verification of
these kinds of systems.  Deductive verification in a proof assistant such
as Coq is a promising technique for this verification because it (1)
justifies all verification from first principles, (2) is not limited to
classes of systems for which full automation is possible, and (3) provides
a platform for proving powerful, higher-order modularity theorems that are
crucial for scaling verification to complex systems.  In this paper, we
demonstrate the practicality, utility, and scalability of this approach by
developing in Coq sound and powerful rules for modular construction and
verification of sampled-data cyber-physical systems.  We evaluate these
rules by using them to verify a number of non-trivial controllers enforcing
safety properties of a quadcopter, e.g. a geo-fence.  We show that our
controllers are realistic by running them on a real, flying quadcopter.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> The safety-critical aspects of cyber-physical systems
  motivate the need for rigorous analysis of these systems. In the
  literature this work is often done using idealized models of systems
  where the analysis can be carried out using high-level reasoning
  techniques such as Lyapunov functions and model checking. In this paper
  we present VeriDrone, a foundational framework for reasoning about
  cyber-physical systems at all levels from high-level models to C code
  that implements the system. VeriDrone is a library within the Coq proof
  assistant enabling us to build on its foundational implementation, its
  interactive development environments, and its wealth of libraries
  capturing interesting theories ranging from real numbers and differential
  equations to verified compilers and floating point numbers. These
  features make proof assistants in general, and Coq in particular, a
  powerful platform for unifying foundational results about safety-critical
  systems and ensuring important properties at <i>all</i> levels of the stack.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> We increasingly rely on computers to interact with the
  physical world for us.  At the large end, software underlies the control
  systems of commercial aircraft and power plants, and at the small end it
  controls medical devices and hobbiest UAVs.  The failure of any of these
  systems can have severe consequences which are often measured in the loss
  of human lives.  Formal verification has proven a promising approach to
  achieving very strong guarantees in more classic areas of computer science.
  In this work we present an overview of our experiences formalizing
  stability properties of hybrid systems using the Coq proof assistant.

    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Unsafe behavior of hybrid systems can have disastrous
      consequences, motivating the need for formal verification of the software
      running on these systems. Foundational verification in a proof assistant
      such as Coq is a promising technique that can provide extremely strong,
      foundational, guarantees about software systems. In this paper, we show how
      to apply this technique to hybrid systems.  We define a TLA-inspired
      formalism in Coq for reasoning about hybrid systems and use it to verify
      two quadcopter modules: the first limits the quadcopter's velocity and the
      second limits its altitude.  We ran both of these modules on an actual
      quadcopter, and they worked as intended.  We also discuss lessons learned
      from our experience foundationally verifying hybrid systems.
