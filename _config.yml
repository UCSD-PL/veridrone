    This project investigates the application of a technique called
    Foundational Verification to cyber-physical systems, paving the way to reaching
    previously unattainable levels of safety for cyber-physical
    systems. To make sure that the techniques in this project are
    practical, they will be evaluated within the context of a real
    flying quadcopter.
