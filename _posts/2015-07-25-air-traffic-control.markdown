It looks like Google and a bunch of other companies are investigating an
[air-traffic control system for
drones](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-24/google-has-way-to-unclog-drone-filled-skies-like-it-did-the-web). It
would be pretty exciting to see "thousands of drones...routinely ply the
skies above cities." It also opens up an interesting long-term direction
for our project: distributed-systems aspects of UAV safety.
