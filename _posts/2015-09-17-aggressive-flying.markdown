Again, we're catching up with our video archive. Here is a video where
we are testing our Coq verified height limiter with some aggressive
flying close to the height boundary. First, I try flying up to the
height boundary while flying aggressively to the right. Then, with
throttle pushed all the way up, I try various motion in other
directions, including so-called yaw (essentially pivoting).
