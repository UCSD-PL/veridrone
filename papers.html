<p><b>Abstract:</b> We increasingly rely on computers to interact with the
  physical world for us.  At the large end, software underlies the control
  systems of commercial aircraft and power plants, and at the small end it
  controls medical devices and hobbiest UAVs.  The failure of any of these
  systems can have severe consequences which are often measured in the loss
  of human lives.  Formal verification has proven a promising approach to
  achieving very strong guarantees in more classic areas of computer science.
  In this work we present an overview of our experiences formalizing
  stability properties of hybrid systems using the Coq proof assistant.

    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Unsafe behavior of hybrid systems can have disastrous
      consequences, motivating the need for formal verification of the software
      running on these systems. Foundational verification in a proof assistant
      such as Coq is a promising technique that can provide extremely strong,
      foundational, guarantees about software systems. In this paper, we show how
      to apply this technique to hybrid systems.  We define a TLA-inspired
      formalism in Coq for reasoning about hybrid systems and use it to verify
      two quadcopter modules: the first limits the quadcopter's velocity and the
      second limits its altitude.  We ran both of these modules on an actual
      quadcopter, and they worked as intended.  We also discuss lessons learned
      from our experience foundationally verifying hybrid systems.
