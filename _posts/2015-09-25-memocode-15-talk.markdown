We just got back from [MEMOCODE
2015](http://memocode.irisa.fr/2015/index.html). The conference was a bit
outside our normal community, which made it a great experience. We had an
opportunity to speak with and hear talks from some cyber-physical systems
experts like [Georgios Fainekos](http://www.public.asu.edu/~gfaineko/),
[Klaus Schneider](http://es.cs.uni-kl.de/people/schneider/), and [Pavithra
Prabhakar](http://software.imdea.org/people/pavithra.prabhakar/) and to see
an interesting keynote presentation from [Rajeev
Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/).

Our own talk was well received. We received some interesting questions on
our proof calculus and on the relationship between our model and the
electrical signals that actually get sent to the motors. The later question
is an interesting topic for a future blog post.

Below is a recording of our talk. Let us know what you think.
