We had a paper accepted to [MEMOCODE
2015](http://memocode.irisa.fr/2015/index.html). The paper describes
preliminary work implementing and formally verifying in Coq an upper bound
altitude monitor and and upper bound vertical velocity monitor for a
quadcopter. Check it out [here](/papers/memocode-15.pdf).

Let us know if you're going to be at MEMOCODE this year. We'd love to chat
with you.
