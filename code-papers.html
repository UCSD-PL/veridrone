<p><b>Abstract:</b> Unsafe behavior of hybrid systems can have disastrous
consequences, motivating the need for formal verification of the software
running on these systems. Foundational verification in a proof assistant
such as Coq is a promising technique that can provide extremely strong,
foundational, guarantees about software systems. In this paper, we show how
to apply this technique to hybrid systems.  We define a TLA-inspired
formalism in Coq for reasoning about hybrid systems and use it to verify
two quadcopter modules: the first limits the quadcopter's velocity and the
second limits its altitude.  We ran both of these modules on an actual
quadcopter, and they worked as intended.  We also discuss lessons learned
from our experience foundationally verifying hybrid systems.
