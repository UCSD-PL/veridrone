<p class="lead">Errors in cyber-physical systems can lead to disastrous
  consequences. Classic examples date back to the Therac-25 radiation
  incidents in 1987 and the Ariane 5 rocket crash in 1996. More recently,
  Toyota's unintended acceleration bug was caused by software errors, and
  certain cars were found vulnerable to attacks that can take over key
  parts of the control software, allowing attackers to even disable the
  brakes remotely. Pacemakers have also been found vulnerable to attacks
  that can cause deadly consequences for the patient.</p>

<p class="lead">To reduce the chances of such errors happening, this
  project investigates the application of a technique called Foundational
  Verification to cyber-physical systems. In Foundational Verification, the
  system being developed is proved correct, in full formal detail, using a
  Proof Assistant. Because proofs in Foundational Verification are carried
  out in such complete detail, this project will pave the way to reaching
  previously unattainable levels of safety for cyber-physical systems. To
  make sure that the techniques in this project are practical, they will be
  evaluated within the context of a real flying quadcopter. Although the
  initial work focuses on quadcopters, the concepts, ideas, and research
  contributions have the potential for transformative impact on other kinds
  of systems, including power-grid software, cars, avionics and medical
  devices (from pacemakers and insulin pumps to defibrillators and
  radiation machines).</p>

<p class="lead"> Here is a video of our quadcopter flying (if you
cannot see the video below, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/videos/first-heigth-shim-flight-short.mp4">here</a> is a
  link). Also note that there is audio! </p>

<p class="lead">This video shows the first test flight for our verified altitude
monitor, which enforces an upper bound on altitude. This monitor could
for example be used to enforce the FAA regulation stating that
recreational quadcopters stay below 400 feet. Our altitude monitor is
placed between the pre-existing software controller that runs on the
quadcopter and the four motors of the quadcopter. In particular, our
monitor takes as input the four motor values produced by the
pre-existing controller, and it produces four new motor values. If our
monitor predicts that no violation of the altitude bound will occur
(in essence because there is still enough time to act to avoid any
violations), our monitor will pass the four motor values
unchanged. However, if our monitor predicts that an intervention is
needed to avoid an altitude bound violation, it produces a new set of
motor values to slow the quadcopter's upward climb.</p>

<p class="lead"> What you see in the video above is that pilot Sorin
is pushing the upward throttle on the handleld remote controller,
which makes the quadcopter climb steadily upward. It's important to
realize that all through the video, Sorin is pushing the throttle
upwards on the quadcopter handheld controller. The quadcopter climbs
until it reaches close to the altitude limit (10 meters), at which
point our monitor engages. Because our monitor engages, the quadcopter
stops going upward, even though Sorin has the throttle all the way up
on the handheld controller. Then at the end of the video, Sorin
disables the monitor (with a switch on the handheld controller), and
the quadcopter shoots up past the altitude bound. You can hear Gregory
proclaim victory!</p>

<p class="lead">You can hear in the video (and we observed in
practice) that there was a slight violation of the bound, which is
due to noise in sensors and actuators. This is a definitely a
challenge we want to address in future work: how to reason formally
and foundationally about this kind of noise.</p>
